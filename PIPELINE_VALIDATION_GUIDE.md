# Email Processing Pipeline Validation Guide

## 🎯 Overview
This guide provides comprehensive testing procedures to validate the complete email processing pipeline from Gmail sync to transaction approval interface.

## 🧪 Automated Testing

### Run the Complete Test Suite
```bash
cd KharchaNepal/backend
python test_complete_pipeline.py
```

This automated test validates:
- ✅ Database connectivity and data integrity
- ✅ Email parser functionality and pattern extraction
- ✅ Data structure compatibility between backend and frontend
- ✅ API endpoint structure and response formats
- ✅ UI component file structure and completeness

## 🔧 Manual Testing Procedures

### 1. Backend Server Testing

#### Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd KharchaNepal/backend
conda activate kharchanepal
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

#### Verify API Documentation
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
- Check that all email processing endpoints are available:
  - `GET /api/email/accounts`
  - `POST /api/email/accounts/{id}/sync`
  - `GET /api/email/approvals`
  - `GET /api/email/financial-emails`
  - `POST /api/email/approvals/{id}/approve`
  - `POST /api/email/approvals/{id}/reject`

### 2. Frontend Application Testing

#### Start the Frontend Server
```bash
cd KharchaNepal/frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Verify UI Components
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:8080` (or `http://localhost:8081` if port 8080 is in use)
- Check that all components load without errors:
  - Email Processing page
  - Transaction Approvals page
  - Financial Emails section (if integrated)

### 3. End-to-End Pipeline Testing

#### Step 1: Gmail Account Connection
1. Navigate to Email Processing page
2. Click "Connect Gmail Account"
3. Complete OAuth flow in popup
4. Verify account appears in connected accounts list
5. Check for success toast notification

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Gmail account successfully connected
- ✅ Account shows as "Active" status
- ✅ No error messages in console

#### Step 2: Email Sync Process
1. Click "Sync" button for connected account
2. Monitor progress indicators
3. Wait for sync completion
4. Check sync results display

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Progress bar shows sync stages
- ✅ Sync completes without errors
- ✅ Results show emails processed count
- ✅ Financial emails detected and filtered
- ✅ Last sync timestamp updated

#### Step 3: Transaction Approval Validation
1. Navigate to Transaction Approvals page
2. Verify pending approvals are displayed
3. Check extracted data visibility
4. Test approval/rejection functionality

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Transaction cards display extracted data:
  - 💰 Amounts (Rs. 1,500, NPR 2,000, etc.)
  - 📅 Dates (2024-01-15, 25/12/2023, etc.)
  - 🏪 Merchants (Amazon Store, Daraz, etc.)
  - 🔢 Transaction IDs (TXN123456789, etc.)
- ✅ Confidence scores visible and accurate
- ✅ Approve/reject buttons functional
- ✅ Modal opens with detailed view

#### Step 4: Data Flow Verification
1. Approve a transaction
2. Check that expense is created
3. Verify transaction removed from pending list
4. Test rejection workflow

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Approved transactions create expense records
- ✅ Rejected transactions are marked as rejected
- ✅ UI updates immediately after approval/rejection
- ✅ Success notifications displayed

## 🔍 Specific Test Cases

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: No Transaction Approvals Showing
**Possible Causes:**
- No financial emails detected during sync
- Data structure mismatch between backend and frontend
- Email processing tasks not running

**Solutions:**
1. Check email sync results for financial email count
2. Verify Celery workers are running
3. Check database for transaction_approvals table data
4. Validate extracted_data structure in database

### Issue: Extracted Data Not Displaying
**Possible Causes:**
- Data stored in old nested format
- UI expecting different data structure
- Missing extracted_data fields

**Solutions:**
1. Check database record structure
2. Verify backward compatibility code is working
3. Re-run email processing for new data structure

### Issue: Email Sync Failing
**Possible Causes:**
- Gmail API credentials invalid
- Rate limiting from Gmail API
- Network connectivity issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check Gmail API credentials in environment variables
2. Verify OAuth tokens are valid
3. Check API quota usage in Google Cloud Console

### Issue: UI Components Not Loading
**Possible Causes:**
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Import path issues

**Solutions:**
1. Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify all component files exist
